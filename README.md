# **Diabetes Prediction Model using Ensemble Learning**  
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients using an ensemble learning approach. The ensemble combines three robust machine learning algorithms: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** to leverage their individual strengths for improved accuracy and robustness.  

1. **Logistic Regression**: Acts as a baseline model to establish interpretability and a linear relationship between features and outcomes.  
2. **Random Forest**: A tree-based ensemble method that captures complex feature interactions and reduces overfitting through bagging.  
3. **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient-boosting algorithm that optimizes predictive performance by handling imbalanced data and reducing bias.  

The final ensemble model aggregates predictions from all three algorithms to deliver a balanced and accurate outcome. Evaluation metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **AUC-ROC** were used to measure performance, ensuring reliability in real-world diabetes prediction.  

This project demonstrates the power of combining linear and non-linear models to create a robust prediction system for medical diagnosis, while also addressing challenges such as feature importance, overfitting, and data imbalance.
